Project Overview

This project consists of four primary components:

1. Input Component

Captures and validates user input.

Ensures that only numeric values are accepted.

If a non-numeric value is entered:

Adds is-invalid class to the input.

Displays an error message.

Includes a "Reset" button that clears the input and removes validation errors.

Emits the valid number to other components.

2. Multiply Component

Receives the numeric value emitted by the InputComponent.

If the value is not a number, the component does not render.

Multiplies the received value by 2 (n \* 2) and displays it.

3. Pow Component

Receives the numeric value emitted by the InputComponent.

If the value is not a number, the component does not render.

Raises the received value to the power of itself (n^n) and displays it.

4. Date Component

Receives the numeric value emitted by the InputComponent.

If the value is not a number, the component does not render.

Converts the received value to a date using Unix timestamp (value \* 1000).

Displays the date in the format YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM.
